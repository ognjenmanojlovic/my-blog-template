# My Developer Portfolio Website

This is my very first personal project using [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/).  
The goal of this website is to build a foundation where I can share my **projects, blog posts, and learning journey** in the fields of IT, DevSecOps, and Cloud.  

In the future, this portfolio will grow with more projects, documentation, and technical insights.

## 🚀 Project Description

This repository contains the source code for my **developer portfolio and blog**, built with Docusaurus.  
It is a static site that supports:

- 📖 A documentation section to organize projects and notes  
- 📝 A blog to share updates, progress, and experiences  
- 🎨 Custom React components and styling for a modern look  
- 🌍 Easy deployment on GitHub Pages or other hosting providers  

---

## 📂 Repository Structure

- `blog/` → Markdown files for blog posts  
- `docs/` → Documentation (e.g. projects, knowledge base)  
- `src/` → Custom React components and CSS for layout & theming  
- `static/` → Static assets (images, icons, logos)  
- `sidebars.ts` → Sidebar configuration for docs  
- `docusaurus.config.ts` → Main configuration file for Docusaurus  
- `build/` → Auto-generated static site (after build)

## 🛠️ Quickstart

### Prerequisites
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v16 or newer)  
- [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) (recommended package manager)  

### Install dependencies
```bash
pnpm install
```

### Start local development
```bash
pnpm start
```
This will start a local dev server at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).  
Changes are hot-reloaded automatically.

### Build the static site
```bash
pnpm build
```
Outputs production-ready files into the `build/` directory.

## 🚢 Deployment

To deploy on GitHub Pages:  
```bash
USE_SSH=true pnpm deploy
```

Alternative (without SSH):  
```bash

```

This command builds the site and pushes it to the `gh-pages` branch.

## 🌱 Future Plans
