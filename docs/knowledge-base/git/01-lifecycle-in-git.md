Hereâ€™s a brief Git lifecycle for **clone**, **commit**, and **push**:

- **Clone**: Copy an existing remote repository to your local machine.
- **Commit**: Save changes made to files in your local repository.
  - Files are first staged (`git add`), then committed (`git commit`).
- **Push**: Send your committed changes from the local repository to the remote repository.

This process repeats as you make more changes and synchronize with the remote repository.
